# Generation-READ

## Description 
Generation-READ is a program that generates a README.md file for the user. It asks relevant questions about the README and automatically creates one with the appropriate markdown based on the user's answers. 

## Motivation
When I worked at a HVAC shop one of the technicians-an older Belarusian guy-once said to me "laziness is the mother of progress" and that always stuck with me. The best tools we have at our disposal are the ones that save time and effort. So what better way to save time with a README than having a template at your disposal ready to go?

## Technologies used
* JavaScript - The heart that allows this project to function.
* Node.js - What allows this to be executed within the Command Line Interface.
* Inquirer - A package pulled from npmjs.com to prompt the user and collect answers.
* VS Code - The IDE that served as a canvas for my code.
* shields.io - To create a shield for each license.
## Challenges 
As a coding bootcamp student, my main challenge was applying the knowledge I had while supplementing what I lacked through research to bring this project to life.

## Installation 
(Installation instructions are for VS Code)

NOTE: User must have Node.js installed to use this program. https://nodejs.org/en. 

* Clone the repository by clicking on the "code" drop down, copying the provided URL whether it's SSH or otherwise and entering "git clon <URL>" into your command line interface (CLI).
* When in the CLI use the command "cd Generation-READ" to get to the correct directory.
* Once the directory is reached use the command "code ." to open it in VS Code.
* Once in VS Code open the terminal within VS Code.
* This code uses the inquirer package so the user will be required to install it. Use the terminal in VS Code and type "npm install" to get inquirer.

## How To Use
* Make sure you have the terminal open in VS Code and simply type "npm start" and press enter.
* Answer all of the questions, press enter after each answer.
* Scroll to whichever license you need using the arrow keys and press enter.
* Once all steps are finished the program will automatically generate a README.md file populated with all your answers.
